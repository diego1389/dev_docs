Cloud computing:
    - Routers know where to send your packages on the internet.
    - Switch takes a package and send it to the correct server / client on your network.
    - Scaling is limited in traditional architectures.
    - Clound computing is the on demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources.
    - Pay as you go pricing.
    - You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly.
    - **Private cloud:** cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
    - **Public cloud:** Azure, Google cloud and AWS.
        - Delivered over the internet.
    - **Hybrid cloud:**
        - Keep some services on premises and extend some others to the cloud.
    - Five characteristics of cloud computing:
        1. On demand and self-service.
        2. Broad network access (available over the network and can be accessed by diverse client platforms).
        3. Multi-tenancy an resource pooling (multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and security with security and privacy). Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources.
        4. Rapid elasticity and scalability.
