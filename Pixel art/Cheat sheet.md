**Hue**: When you open a color picker it has three elements: hue, saturation, value and alpha. The color is not the hue. Hue goes to 360 degrees. 
    * In RGB (for digital media) hue jumps in 120 degrees. 0 is red hue. 120 is green hue, 240 is blue hue and 360 is red hue.
    * In CMYK (for printing media) the hue jumps in 60 degrees: 0 is red, 60 is yellow, 180 cyan and 300 is magenta. 

* Saturation and value go from 0 to 100.

**Saturation** is the intensity of a color. If you desaturate the color it goes grayer each time. It is not adding white and black colors. To desaturate you add color opposite in the color wheel. 

**Value** How much white or black tint you add to your color.
